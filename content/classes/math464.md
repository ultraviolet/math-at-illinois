# Statistics and Probability II (STAT410/MATH464)

## Official Course Description

Moment-generating functions, transformations of random variables, normal
sampling theory, sufficiency, best estimators, maximum likelihood
estimators, confidence intervals, most powerful tests, unbiased tests,
and chi-square tests.

### Unofficial Description (Student Feedback)

This class is considered very difficult for many students in the
statistics major. However, a lot of the difficulty of the class can be
offset by having strong calculus fundamentals, specifically being
proficient in double integration and change of variables. A lot of the
necessary skills needed from STAT400/MATH463 are provided in the class
such as conditional probability and maximum likelihood estimators
(MLEs). Do note that the class has a textbook, namely Hogg and Craig\'s
Introduction to Mathematical Statistics, it is not required.

## Official Prerequisites

[[STAT400 (MATH463)]]  [[MATH241]]

#### Notes on Enrolling

Enrollment is initially only open to Mathematics, Statistics, and
Statistics + Computer Science majors

## Degree Requirements Fulfilled

This course satisfies a core requirement or an elective requirement\*
for the following programs:

Mathematics, BS

Mathematics, BS (Data Optimization)

Mathematics and Computer Science, BS (Group I) 

Statistics, BS

Electrical Engineering, BS 

Computer Engineering, BS

## General Advice

Utilize the Canvas page for this class. A lot of the problems are
identical to the ones on the Canvas page. The professor will usually
also post lecture videos which are a good resource. STAT410 is also
pretty self-contained, so it\'s more practical to be good at calculus
than reviewing STAT400 although reviewing it will not hurt at all.

## General Postrequisites

[[MATH466]] [[MATH563]] [[MATH564]]

## Other Information

This class can be substituted for STAT420 for both the math minor, stat
minor and the data optimization concentration for the mathematics major.
